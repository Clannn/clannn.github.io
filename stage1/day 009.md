### Numeric Representations

#### Floating-Point Notation

​	A floating-point number is broken into three parts: 1. the *mantissa*, which contains the relevant digits of the number, 2. the *exponent*, which indicates where the decimal point lies in that digits, and 3. a *sign bit*, which of course indicates whether the value is positive(0) or negative(1).

​	A 32-bit floating-point number will be represented with the sign $s$ in the most significant bit, followed by 8 bits of exponent $e$ and finally 23 bits of mantissa $m$. The value $v$ represented by $s$, $e$, and $m$ is 
$$
v=s\times{2^{(e-127)}\times{(1+m)}}
$$
​	$m$ is the fractional value, while the fractional bits represent decreasing *inverse* power of two($\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{8},\cdots$) , stored in the mantissa, so the value represented is really $1+m$. $e$ is between $1$ to $254$, because $0$(`0x00`) and $255$(`0xFF`) is both spacial cases. An exponent of $255$ used for values like not-a-number(`NaN`) and infinity.

​	So the $FLT\_MAX=0x7F7FFFFF=0x00FFFFFF\times{2^{127}}$(`std::numeric_limits<float>::max()`). Our $24$ binary ones were shifted up by $127$ bit positions, leaving $127-23=104$ binary zeros (or $104/4=26$ hexadecimal zeros). If we were to subtract a small number( where “small” means any number composed of fewer than 26 hexadecimal digits ) from `FLA_MAX`, the result would still be `FLT_MAX`, because the small number will shifted down greater than $23$ bit zeros and then become zero!

​	The opposite effect occurs for floating-point values whose magnitudes are much less than one. In this case, the exponent is large but negative, and the significant digits are shifted in the opposite direction. In summary, **we always have the same number of significant digits in our floating-point numbers, and the exponent can be used to shift those significant bits into higher or lower ranges of magnitude**.

​	The $FLT\_MIN=0x00800000=2^{-126}$(`std::numeric_limits<float>::min()`), so there is a finite gap between the value `-FIN_MIN` and `+FLT_MIN`. To resolve this problem, when the exponent had been a $0$(`0x00`),  the implicit leading $1$ that normally sits in front of the bits of the mantissa is changed to $0$. It provides greater precision near zero.

***Machine Epsilon***

​	The *machine epsilon* is defined to be the smallest floating-point value $1+\varepsilon\ne1$(`std::numeric_limits<float>::epsilon()`). With $23$ bits of precision, the value of $\varepsilon$ is $2^{-23}$. Any new bits contributed adding a value smaller than $\varepsilon$ will get “chopped off” when we try to fit the sum into a mantissa with only 23 bits.

***Unit in the Last Place***

​	Consider two floating-point numbers which are identical in all respects except for the value of the least-significant bit in their mantissas. These two values are said to differ by one *unit in the last place* (1 ULP). if a floating-point value's unbiased exponent is $x$, then 1 ULP$=2^x\cdot\varepsilon$. The concept of ULP illustrates the idea that the precision of a floating-point number depends on its exponent. **Mathematically, the condition $a\geq b$ is equivalent to the condition $a+1ULP>b$ **. Only support greater-than and less-than checks for float.

​	How long can wen run our game before the magnitude of our clock variable get so large that adding $\frac{1}{30}$ second to it no longer changes its value? **The answer is $12.14$ days or $2^{20}$ seconds**. When time less than $2^{18}$, we can get the exact value.

​	It's often important to know exactly how wide a particular variable is.

#### Multibyte Values and Endianness

​	In a 32-bit value, such as `0xABCD1234`, the most-significant byte is `0xAB` and the least-significant byte is `0x34`. The same concepts apply to 64-bit and 16-bit values.

​	Multibyte integers can be stored into memory in one of two ways, and different microprocessor may differ in their choice of storage method.

- *Little-endian*. If a microprocessor stores the least significant byte of a multibyte value at a lower memory address than the most significant byte, we say that the processor is little-endian.
- *Big-endian*. If a microprocessor stores the most significant byte of a multibyte value at a lower memory address than the least significant byte, we say that the processor is big-endian.

​	Windows or Linux machine running an Intel processor(which is little-endian), but Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3(which can be configured to use either endianness, but is big-endian by default). Now imagine what happens when you generate a data file on an Intel processor and then try to load that data file into your engine running on a PowerPC processor. There are at least two solutions to this problem.

- You could write all your data files as text, store all multibyte numbers as sequences of decimal or hexadecimal digits. This would be an inefficient use of disk space
-  You can have your tools endian-swap the data prior to writing it into a binary data file.

​	The swap function might be defined like:

```c++
inline U32 swapU32(U32 value)
{
    return ((value & 0x000000FF) << 24)
         | ((value & 0x0000FF00) << 8)
         | ((value & 0x00FF0000) >> 8)
         | ((value & 0xFF000000) >> 24);
}

struct Example
{
    U32 m_a;
    U32 m_b;
};

void writeExampleStruct(Example& x, Stream& stream)
{
    stream.writeU32(swapU32(x.m_a));
    stream.writeU32(swapU32(x.m_b));
}
```

​	Some compilers provide built-in endian-swapping macros, but such compiler-specific facilities are of course non-portable.
